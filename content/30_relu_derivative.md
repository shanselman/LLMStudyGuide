# Question 30: What is the derivative of the ReLU function, and why is it significant?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
The ReLU function, f(x) = max(0, x), has a derivative:
f'(x) = {1 if x > 0, 0 otherwise}
Its sparsity and non-linearity prevent vanishing gradients, making ReLU computationally efficient and widely used in LLMs for robust training.

**AI Answer:**
The ReLU derivative is a step function (1 for x>0, 0 otherwise) that prevents vanishing gradients while introducing sparsity, making it computationally efficient and widely used in transformer feed-forward networks.

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
ReLU'(x) = {1 if x > 0, 0 if x â‰¤ 0}
```

**Significance:**
- **Gradient flow**: Prevents vanishing gradients for positive activations
- **Sparsity**: Creates sparse representations
- **Computational efficiency**: Simple thresholding operation

**Variants in LLMs:**
- **GELU**: Smooth approximation used in BERT, GPT
- **Swish**: Self-gated activation function
- **ReLU6**: Bounded version for mobile deployments
