# Question 10: What are embeddings, and how are they initialized in LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Embeddings are dense vectors that represent tokens in a continuous space, capturing semantic and syntactic properties. They are often initialized randomly or with pre-trained models like GloVe, then fine-tuned during training. For example, the embedding for "dog" might evolve to reflect its context in pet-related tasks, enhancing model accuracy.

**AI Answer:**
Embeddings are dense vector representations that map discrete tokens (words, subwords, characters) into continuous vector spaces where semantic and syntactic relationships are preserved through geometric relationships.

**Types of Embeddings in LLMs:**

**1. Token Embeddings:**
- Map vocabulary items to dense vectors
- Dimension typically 512-4096 in modern LLMs
- Learned during training to capture semantic meaning

**2. Position Embeddings:**
- Encode position information in sequences
- Absolute vs. relative positioning
- Essential for transformer models

**3. Segment Embeddings:**
- Distinguish between different segments (used in BERT)
- Help model understand document structure

**Initialization Strategies:**

**1. Random Initialization:**
```python
# Xavier/Glorot initialization
embedding_matrix = torch.randn(vocab_size, embed_dim) * sqrt(2.0 / (vocab_size + embed_dim))

# Normal initialization
embedding_matrix = torch.randn(vocab_size, embed_dim) * 0.02
```

**2. Pre-trained Initialization:**
- **Word2Vec**: Skip-gram or CBOW vectors
- **GloVe**: Global vector representations
- **FastText**: Subword-based embeddings
- Transfer learning from smaller to larger models

**3. Subword-aware Initialization:**
- Initialize based on constituent subword pieces
- Particularly useful for rare words
- Helps with out-of-vocabulary handling

**Mathematical Properties:**

**Geometric Relationships:**
- Similar words cluster together in embedding space
- Arithmetic operations capture relationships:
  - king - man + woman ‚âà queen
  - Paris - France + Italy ‚âà Rome

**Distance Metrics:**
- **Cosine Similarity**: cos(Œ∏) = (A¬∑B)/(||A||√ó||B||)
- **Euclidean Distance**: ||A - B||‚ÇÇ
- **Manhattan Distance**: ||A - B||‚ÇÅ

**Training Dynamics:**

**Gradient Updates:**
- Embeddings updated through backpropagation
- Frequency-based learning: common words update more
- Regularization prevents overfitting

**Vocabulary Considerations:**
- **Vocabulary Size**: Trade-off between coverage and efficiency
- **Subword Tokenization**: Handles rare words better
- **Special Tokens**: [CLS], [SEP], [MASK], [PAD]

**Advanced Techniques:**

**1. Tied Embeddings:**
- Share input and output embedding layers
- Reduces parameters and improves generalization
- Common in language models

**2. Adaptive Embeddings:**
- Different dimensions for different frequency bands
- Rare words get smaller embeddings
- Improves efficiency

**3. Contextual Embeddings:**
- Same word gets different embeddings in different contexts
- Learned through transformer layers
- Captures polysemy and context dependence

**Evaluation Methods:**

**Intrinsic Evaluation:**
- Word similarity tasks (WordSim-353, SimLex-999)
- Analogy tasks (Google analogy dataset)
- Clustering analysis

**Extrinsic Evaluation:**
- Downstream task performance
- Probing tasks for linguistic properties
- Transfer learning effectiveness
