# Question 47: How do LLMs differ from traditional statistical language models?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
LLMs use transformer architectures, massive datasets, and unsupervised pretraining, unlike statistical models (e.g., N-grams) that rely on simpler, supervised methods. LLMs handle long-range dependencies, contextual embeddings, and diverse tasks, but require significant computational resources.

**AI Answer:**
LLMs differ fundamentally from traditional statistical models in architecture, scale, learning mechanisms, and capabilities, representing a paradigm shift from discrete probabilistic models to continuous neural representations.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Traditional (N-gram) | Modern LLMs |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | Discrete probability tables | Neural networks (transformers) |
| **Context** | Fixed window (2-5 words) | Long sequences (1000s of tokens) |
| **Parameters** | Millions | Billions to trillions |
| **Learning** | Count-based statistics | Gradient-based optimization |
| **Representations** | Sparse, discrete | Dense, continuous |

**Traditional Models (N-grams):**
- **Mechanism**: P(word|previous_n_words) based on corpus counts
- **Limitations**: Fixed context window, sparse data problem
- **Smoothing**: Techniques to handle unseen n-grams

**Modern LLMs:**
- **Mechanism**: Neural attention over full context
- **Advantages**: Long-range dependencies, compositional understanding
- **Emergent capabilities**: Reasoning, few-shot learning, instruction following
