# Question 4: What distinguishes LoRA from QLoRA in fine-tuning LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a fine-tuning method that adds low-rank matrices to a model's layers, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal memory overhead. QLoRA extends this by applying quantization (e.g., 4-bit precision) to further reduce memory usage while maintaining accuracy. For example, QLoRA can fine-tune a 70B-parameter model on a single GPU, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.

**AI Answer:**
Both LoRA and QLoRA are parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that enable adaptation of large models with minimal computational resources, but they differ in their approach to memory optimization.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
- Freezes original model weights
- Adds small trainable matrices A and B such that Î”W = BA
- Reduces trainable parameters from billions to millions
- Maintains full precision (typically FP16)

**Mathematical Representation:**
```
h = Wâ‚€x + Î”Wx = Wâ‚€x + BAx
```
Where r << min(d_in, d_out) for matrices A âˆˆ R^(dÃ—r) and B âˆˆ R^(rÃ—d)

**QLoRA (Quantized LoRA):**
- Combines LoRA with 4-bit quantization
- Uses NormalFloat4 (NF4) quantization for base model
- Keeps LoRA adapters in 16-bit precision
- Enables training 65B parameter models on single GPU

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | LoRA | QLoRA |
|--------|------|-------|
| Memory Usage | ~50% reduction | ~75% reduction |
| Base Model Precision | FP16 | 4-bit (NF4) |
| Training Speed | Faster | Slower due to quantization |
| Hardware Requirements | Multiple GPUs for large models | Single GPU for 65B models |
