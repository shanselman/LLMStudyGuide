# Question 40: How does knowledge graph integration improve LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Knowledge graphs provide structured, factual data, enhancing LLMs by:
• Reducing Hallucinations: Verifying facts against the graph.
• Improving Reasoning: Leveraging entity relationships.
• Enhancing Context: Offering structured context for better responses.
This is valuable for question answering and entity recognition.

**AI Answer:**
Knowledge graph integration enhances LLMs by providing structured factual information, reducing hallucinations, and enabling more accurate reasoning through explicit knowledge representation.

**Integration Methods:**
- **Retrieval-based**: Query KG during generation
- **Embedding-based**: Pre-train on KG-augmented text
- **Fusion architectures**: Joint KG-text encoders

**Benefits:**
- **Factual accuracy**: Verifiable information sources
- **Structured reasoning**: Follow entity relationships
- **Controllable generation**: Ground outputs in facts
- **Reduced hallucinations**: External knowledge verification

**Implementation:**
```python
def kg_augmented_generation(query, kg, llm):
    # Extract entities from query
    entities = extract_entities(query)
    
    # Retrieve relevant KG subgraph
    kg_context = kg.get_subgraph(entities, hops=2)
    
    # Augment prompt with KG facts
    augmented_prompt = f"Facts: {kg_context}\nQuery: {query}\nAnswer:"
    
    return llm.generate(augmented_prompt)
```
