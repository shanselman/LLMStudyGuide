# Question 19: What are generative versus discriminative models in NLP?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Generative models, like GPT, model joint probabilities to create new data, such as text or images. Discriminative models, like BERT for classification, model conditional probabilities to distinguish classes, e.g., sentiment analysis. Generative models excel in creation, while discriminative models focus on accurate classification.

**AI Answer:**
Generative and discriminative models represent two fundamental approaches to machine learning that differ in how they model the relationship between inputs and outputs. Understanding this distinction is crucial for choosing the right approach for different NLP tasks.

**Fundamental Definitions:**

**Generative Models:**
- Model the joint probability distribution P(X, Y)
- Can generate new data samples
- Learn how data is generated
- Answer: "What is the probability of this input and output occurring together?"

**Discriminative Models:**
- Model the conditional probability P(Y|X)
- Focus on decision boundaries
- Learn to distinguish between classes
- Answer: "Given this input, what is the most likely output?"

**Mathematical Distinction:**

**Generative Approach:**
```
P(Y|X) = P(X, Y) / P(X) = P(X|Y) * P(Y) / P(X)
```
- Models both P(X|Y) and P(Y)
- Can compute P(X) by marginalization
- Requires more parameters but provides complete model

**Discriminative Approach:**
```
P(Y|X) directly modeled
```
- Directly optimizes what we want to predict
- More parameter efficient for classification
- Cannot generate new samples

**NLP Examples:**

**Generative Models:**

**1. Language Models (GPT family):**
```python
# GPT generates text autoregressively
P(sentence) = P(w₁) * P(w₂|w₁) * P(w₃|w₁,w₂) * ...
```
- Can generate coherent text
- Captures language statistics
- Useful for text generation, completion

**2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
```python
# Learn latent representation and generate from it
P(X) = ∫ P(X|Z) * P(Z) dZ
```
- Generate text from latent codes
- Control text properties through latent space
- Useful for text style transfer

**3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
```python
# Generator creates samples, discriminator judges them
Generator: Z → X
Discriminator: X → Real/Fake
```
- Generate realistic text samples
- Challenging to train for discrete text
- Used for data augmentation

**Discriminative Models:**

**1. Text Classifiers (BERT for classification):**
```python
# Classify text into categories
P(sentiment|text) = softmax(BERT(text))
```
- Sentiment analysis, topic classification
- Named entity recognition
- Question answering

**2. Sequence Labeling Models:**
```python
# Tag each token in sequence
P(tags|tokens) = CRF(BiLSTM(tokens))
```
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Named entity recognition
- Semantic role labeling

**3. Neural Machine Translation (Encoder-Decoder):**
```python
# Discriminative: P(target|source)
P(French|English) = Decoder(Encoder(English))
```
- Focuses on translation quality
- Doesn't model source language distribution
- Optimized for translation accuracy

**Detailed Comparison:**

| Aspect | Generative | Discriminative |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Objective** | Model P(X,Y) | Model P(Y\|X) |
| **Data Generation** | Can generate new samples | Cannot generate samples |
| **Parameter Efficiency** | Higher parameter needs | More parameter efficient |
| **Training Data** | Needs complete data | Can handle missing features |
| **Overfitting** | Less prone (smoother) | More prone (sharper boundaries) |
| **Interpretability** | Better understanding of data | Focus on decision making |

**Hybrid Approaches:**

**1. Encoder-Decoder Architectures:**
```python
# Encoder: Discriminative (understanding)
# Decoder: Generative (generation)
Encoder: P(representation|input)
Decoder: P(output|representation)
```

**2. Conditional Generative Models:**
```python
# Generate output conditioned on input
P(Y|X) where Y is generated sequence
```
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Dialogue systems

**3. Masked Language Models (BERT):**
```python
# Generative objective but discriminative use
Training: P(masked_tokens|context)
Usage: P(class|input) - discriminative
```

**Task-Specific Applications:**

**When to Use Generative:**
1. **Text Generation**: Stories, articles, code
2. **Data Augmentation**: Create synthetic training data
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: Learn without labeled data
4. **Creative Applications**: Poetry, music, art
5. **Few-shot Learning**: Generate examples for new tasks

**When to Use Discriminative:**
1. **Classification Tasks**: Sentiment, spam detection
2. **Information Extraction**: NER, relation extraction
3. **Question Answering**: Reading comprehension
4. **Ranking Tasks**: Information retrieval
5. **Structured Prediction**: Parsing, tagging

**Training Considerations:**

**Generative Model Training:**
```python
# Maximum likelihood estimation
loss = -log P(data)

# For language models
loss = -Σ log P(wᵢ|w₁...wᵢ₋₁)
```

**Discriminative Model Training:**
```python
# Cross-entropy for classification
loss = -Σ yᵢ log(P(yᵢ|xᵢ))

# Focus on decision boundaries
```

**Evaluation Metrics:**

**Generative Models:**
- **Perplexity**: How well model predicts next token
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: Quality of generated text
- **Human Evaluation**: Fluency, coherence, creativity
- **Likelihood**: Probability assigned to held-out data

**Discriminative Models:**
- **Accuracy**: Correct predictions
- **F1-Score**: Balance precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Classification performance
- **Task-specific metrics**: BLEU for translation, etc.

**Modern Trends:**

**1. Scale and Versatility:**
- Large generative models (GPT-3/4) can perform discriminative tasks
- In-context learning bridges generative and discriminative approaches
- Prompting enables task specification without retraining

**2. Multi-modal Models:**
- Generate and discriminate across text, images, audio
- Unified architectures for multiple modalities
- Cross-modal understanding and generation

**3. Efficiency Improvements:**
- Smaller generative models through distillation
- Efficient discriminative models through pruning
- Hybrid approaches combining benefits
