# Question 39: How do discriminative and generative AI differ?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Discriminative AI, like sentiment classifiers, predicts labels based on input features, modeling conditional probabilities. Generative AI, like GPT, creates new data by modeling joint probabilities, suitable for tasks like text or image generation, offering creative flexibility.

**AI Answer:**
Discriminative AI models conditional probabilities P(Y|X) for classification and prediction tasks, while generative AI models joint probabilities P(X,Y) to create new data samples and understand data distributions.

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Discriminative | Generative |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Goal** | Classify/predict | Generate/create |
| **Models** | P(Y\|X) | P(X,Y) or P(X) |
| **Examples** | BERT classification | GPT text generation |
| **Use Cases** | Sentiment analysis | Creative writing |

**Applications:**
- **Discriminative**: Classification, NER, QA
- **Generative**: Text generation, code synthesis, creative tasks
