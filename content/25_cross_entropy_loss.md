# Question 25: Why is cross-entropy loss used in language modeling?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Cross-entropy loss measures the divergence between predicted and true token probabilities:
L = -Œ£yi log(≈∑i)
It penalizes incorrect predictions, encouraging accurate token selection. In language modeling, it ensures the model assigns high probabilities to correct next tokens, optimizing performance.

**AI Answer:**
Cross-entropy loss is the standard loss function for language modeling because it naturally measures the dissimilarity between predicted probability distributions and true token distributions, providing strong gradients for learning and aligning perfectly with the probabilistic nature of language generation.

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Cross-Entropy Formula:**
```
L = -Œ£·µ¢ y·µ¢ log(≈∑·µ¢)

For language modeling:
L = -Œ£‚Çú log P(w‚Çú | w‚ÇÅ, ..., w‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
```

Where:
- y·µ¢: True distribution (one-hot for single token)
- ≈∑·µ¢: Predicted probability distribution
- w‚Çú: Token at position t

**Information-Theoretic Interpretation:**

**1. Entropy:**
```
H(Y) = -Œ£·µ¢ P(y·µ¢) log P(y·µ¢)
# Measures uncertainty in true distribution
```

**2. Cross-Entropy:**
```
H(Y, ≈∂) = -Œ£·µ¢ P(y·µ¢) log Q(y·µ¢)
# Measures dissimilarity between distributions
```

**3. KL Divergence:**
```
D_KL(Y||≈∂) = H(Y, ≈∂) - H(Y)
# Cross-entropy minimization ‚â° KL divergence minimization
```

**Why Cross-Entropy for Language Modeling:**

**1. Probabilistic Nature:**
```python
# Language modeling as probability estimation
P("The cat sat on the mat") = 
    P("The") √ó 
    P("cat" | "The") √ó 
    P("sat" | "The cat") √ó 
    P("on" | "The cat sat") √ó 
    P("the" | "The cat sat on") √ó 
    P("mat" | "The cat sat on the")

# Cross-entropy directly optimizes these probabilities
```

**2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
```python
# Cross-entropy loss ‚â° Negative log-likelihood
def cross_entropy_loss(predictions, targets):
    return -torch.sum(targets * torch.log(predictions + 1e-12))

def negative_log_likelihood(predictions, targets):
    return -torch.log(predictions[range(len(targets)), targets])

# For one-hot targets, these are equivalent
```

**3. Gradient Properties:**
```python
# Softmax + Cross-entropy has clean gradients
‚àÇL/‚àÇlogits = ≈∑ - y

# Simple, stable, and interpretable gradients
# No vanishing gradient problems
```

**Implementation Details:**

**Standard Implementation:**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def language_modeling_loss(logits, targets):
    """
    Args:
        logits: [batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size]
        targets: [batch_size, seq_len] - token indices
    """
    # Reshape for cross-entropy
    logits_flat = logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1))  # [batch*seq, vocab]
    targets_flat = targets.view(-1)                 # [batch*seq]
    
    # Compute cross-entropy
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_flat, targets_flat, reduction='mean')
    return loss
```

**Numerical Stability:**
```python
def stable_cross_entropy(logits, targets):
    """Numerically stable cross-entropy"""
    # Log-softmax is more stable than log(softmax())
    log_probs = F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    
    # Gather target probabilities
    target_log_probs = torch.gather(log_probs, -1, targets.unsqueeze(-1))
    
    # Negative log likelihood
    loss = -target_log_probs.mean()
    return loss
```

**Comparison with Alternative Loss Functions:**

**1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
```python
# Problems with MSE for classification:
# - Doesn't match probabilistic interpretation
# - Gradients can be very small near correct predictions
# - No theoretical justification for discrete tokens

def mse_loss(predictions, targets_onehot):
    return torch.mean((predictions - targets_onehot) ** 2)
```

**2. Hinge Loss:**
```python
# Used in SVMs, but not suitable for multi-class with large vocab
def hinge_loss(scores, targets):
    # Doesn't provide probability estimates
    # Not differentiable everywhere
    pass
```

**3. Focal Loss:**
```python
# Addresses class imbalance by focusing on hard examples
def focal_loss(predictions, targets, alpha=1, gamma=2):
    ce_loss = F.cross_entropy(predictions, targets, reduction='none')
    pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)
    focal_loss = alpha * (1 - pt) ** gamma * ce_loss
    return focal_loss.mean()
```

**Perplexity Connection:**

**Definition:**
```
Perplexity = exp(Cross_Entropy_Loss)
PPL = exp(-1/N Œ£·µ¢ log P(w·µ¢))
```

**Interpretation:**
```python
# Perplexity as "effective vocabulary size"
# PPL = 50 means model is as confused as random choice among 50 words
# Lower perplexity = better model

def compute_perplexity(loss):
    return torch.exp(loss)

# Example:
cross_entropy = 3.5
perplexity = torch.exp(torch.tensor(3.5))  # ‚âà 30.0
```

**Label Smoothing:**

**Motivation:**
- Hard targets can cause overconfidence
- Regularization effect
- Better calibrated probabilities

**Implementation:**
```python
def label_smoothing_cross_entropy(predictions, targets, smoothing=0.1):
    """Apply label smoothing to cross-entropy loss"""
    vocab_size = predictions.size(-1)
    
    # Create smoothed targets
    confidence = 1.0 - smoothing
    smooth_targets = torch.zeros_like(predictions)
    smooth_targets.fill_(smoothing / (vocab_size - 1))
    smooth_targets.scatter_(1, targets.unsqueeze(1), confidence)
    
    # Compute loss with smoothed targets
    log_probs = F.log_softmax(predictions, dim=-1)
    loss = -torch.sum(smooth_targets * log_probs, dim=-1).mean()
    
    return loss
```

**Masked Language Modeling:**

**BERT-style MLM Loss:**
```python
def masked_lm_loss(predictions, targets, mask):
    """Only compute loss on masked positions"""
    # predictions: [batch, seq_len, vocab_size]
    # targets: [batch, seq_len] 
    # mask: [batch, seq_len] - 1 for masked positions
    
    # Flatten tensors
    predictions_flat = predictions.view(-1, predictions.size(-1))
    targets_flat = targets.view(-1)
    mask_flat = mask.view(-1)
    
    # Only compute loss on masked tokens
    masked_predictions = predictions_flat[mask_flat.bool()]
    masked_targets = targets_flat[mask_flat.bool()]
    
    loss = F.cross_entropy(masked_predictions, masked_targets)
    return loss
```

**Sequence-Level Considerations:**

**Exposure Bias:**
```python
# Training uses teacher forcing: P(w‚Çú | w‚ÇÅ...w‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
# Inference uses model's own predictions: P(w‚Çú | ≈µ‚ÇÅ...≈µ‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
# Can lead to error accumulation

# Solutions:
# 1. Scheduled sampling
# 2. Sequence-level training (REINFORCE)
# 3. Minimum Risk Training (MRT)
```

**Advanced Techniques:**

**1. Contrastive Learning:**
```python
# SimCLM, SimCSE for representation learning
def contrastive_loss(anchors, positives, negatives, temperature=0.07):
    # Encourage similar representations for related sequences
    pass
```

**2. Knowledge Distillation:**
```python
def distillation_loss(student_logits, teacher_logits, targets, alpha=0.5, temperature=3):
    # Combine hard targets with soft teacher predictions
    hard_loss = F.cross_entropy(student_logits, targets)
    
    soft_targets = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=-1)
    soft_loss = F.kl_div(
        F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=-1),
        soft_targets,
        reduction='batchmean'
    ) * temperature ** 2
    
    return alpha * hard_loss + (1 - alpha) * soft_loss
```

**Computational Optimizations:**

**1. Hierarchical Softmax:**
```python
# Reduce O(V) to O(log V) for large vocabularies
# Organize vocabulary in binary tree
# Used in word2vec, less common in modern LLMs
```

**2. Adaptive Softmax:**
```python
# Different capacity for different frequency words
# Frequent words: full computation
# Rare words: reduced computation
```
