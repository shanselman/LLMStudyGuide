# Question 41: What is zero-shot learning, and how do LLMs implement it?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Zero-shot learning allows LLMs to perform untrained tasks using general knowledge from pretraining. For example, prompted with "Classify this review as positive or negative," an LLM can infer sentiment without task-specific data, showcasing its versatility.

**AI Answer:**
Zero-shot learning enables LLMs to perform tasks without task-specific training examples by leveraging general knowledge acquired during pre-training and clear task instructions.

**Mechanism:**
- **Pre-training knowledge**: Broad understanding from diverse text
- **Instruction following**: Task specification through prompts
- **In-context learning**: Understanding from prompt examples

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "Classify the sentiment of this review as positive, negative, or neutral: 'The movie was absolutely fantastic!'"
Output: "Positive"
```

**Enabling Factors:**
- **Scale**: Larger models show better zero-shot capabilities
- **Instruction tuning**: Training on diverse instruction-following tasks
- **Emergent abilities**: Capabilities that appear at sufficient scale
