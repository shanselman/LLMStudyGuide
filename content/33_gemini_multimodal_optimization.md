# Question 33: How does Gemini optimize multimodal LLM training?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Gemini enhances efficiency via:
• Unified Architecture: Combines text and image processing for parameter efficiency.
• Advanced Attention: Improves cross-modal learning stability.
• Data Efficiency: Uses self-supervised techniques to reduce labeled data needs.
These features make Gemini more stable and scalable than models like GPT-4.

**AI Answer:**
Gemini optimizes multimodal training through unified architecture design, efficient cross-modal attention mechanisms, and advanced training techniques that handle text, images, and code simultaneously.

**Key Optimizations:**
- **Unified tokenization**: Common vocabulary for multiple modalities
- **Interleaved training**: Mixed multimodal and unimodal batches
- **Efficient attention**: Sparse patterns for long multimodal sequences
