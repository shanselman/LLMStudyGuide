# Question 29: What is KL divergence, and how is it used in LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
KL divergence quantifies the difference between two probability distributions:
D_KL(P||Q) = Σ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))
In LLMs, it evaluates how closely model predictions match true distributions, guiding fine-tuning to improve output quality and alignment with target data.

**AI Answer:**
KL divergence measures the difference between probability distributions, serving as a fundamental metric in LLM training for knowledge distillation, regularization, and distribution alignment.

**Mathematical Definition:**
```
D_KL(P||Q) = Σ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))
```

**LLM Applications:**
- **Knowledge distillation**: Matching student and teacher distributions
- **Variational methods**: VAE-based text generation
- **Distribution regularization**: Preventing overconfident predictions

**Implementation:**
```python
def kl_divergence(p, q, temperature=1.0):
    p_soft = F.softmax(p / temperature, dim=-1)
    q_soft = F.softmax(q / temperature, dim=-1)
    return F.kl_div(q_soft.log(), p_soft, reduction='batchmean')
```
