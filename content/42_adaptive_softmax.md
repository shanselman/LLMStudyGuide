# Question 42: How does Adaptive Softmax optimize LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Adaptive Softmax groups words by frequency, reducing computations for rare words. This lowers the cost of handling large vocabularies, speeding up training and inference while maintaining accuracy, especially in resource-limited settings.

**AI Answer:**
Adaptive Softmax optimizes large vocabulary models by assigning different computational capacity to words based on their frequency, reducing computation for rare words while maintaining accuracy.

**Architecture:**
- **Hierarchical structure**: Frequent words in small clusters
- **Reduced dimensions**: Rare words use smaller embeddings
- **Adaptive computation**: O(log V) vs O(V) complexity

**Benefits:**
- **Speed**: Faster training and inference
- **Memory**: Reduced parameter count
- **Scalability**: Handles very large vocabularies
