# Question 20: How does GPT-4 differ from GPT-3 in features and applications?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3 with:
• Multimodal Input: Processes text and images.
• Larger Context: Handles up to 25,000 tokens versus GPT-3's 4,096.
• Enhanced Accuracy: Reduces factual errors through better fine-tuning.
These improvements expand its use in visual question answering and complex dialogues.

**AI Answer:**
GPT-4 represents a significant advancement over GPT-3, introducing multimodal capabilities, enhanced reasoning, improved safety measures, and better alignment with human values. These improvements expand its applicability and reliability across diverse domains.

**Key Architectural Improvements:**

**1. Multimodal Capabilities:**

**GPT-3:**
- Text-only input and output
- Single modality processing
- Limited to textual understanding

**GPT-4:**
```
Input: Text + Images → Processing → Text Output
```
- **Vision Understanding**: Can analyze images, charts, diagrams
- **Document Processing**: Read and understand PDFs, screenshots
- **Visual Reasoning**: Answer questions about visual content
- **Code from Screenshots**: Generate code from UI mockups

**Example Applications:**
```
User: [Image of a chart] "What does this data show?"
GPT-4: "This chart shows quarterly revenue growth from 2020-2023, 
        with a notable dip in Q2 2020 followed by steady recovery..."
```

**2. Enhanced Context Length:**

**Context Window Comparison:**
- **GPT-3**: 4,096 tokens (~3,000 words)
- **GPT-4**: 8,192 tokens (standard), 32,768 tokens (extended)
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: 128,000 tokens (~300 pages)

**Impact:**
- Process entire documents
- Maintain longer conversations
- Better coherence in extended generation
- More comprehensive analysis tasks

**3. Improved Reasoning Capabilities:**

**Mathematical Reasoning:**
```python
# GPT-3 might struggle with multi-step problems
# GPT-4 shows better step-by-step reasoning

Problem: "If a company's revenue grows by 15% each year, 
         and starts at $1M, what will it be in 5 years?"

GPT-4 Response:
Year 0: $1,000,000
Year 1: $1,000,000 × 1.15 = $1,150,000
Year 2: $1,150,000 × 1.15 = $1,322,500
Year 3: $1,322,500 × 1.15 = $1,520,875
Year 4: $1,520,875 × 1.15 = $1,749,006
Year 5: $1,749,006 × 1.15 = $2,011,357
```

**Logical Reasoning:**
- Better handling of complex logical chains
- Improved consistency in reasoning
- More reliable factual knowledge

**4. Safety and Alignment:**

**Reduced Harmful Content:**
- **GPT-3**: Sometimes generated inappropriate content
- **GPT-4**: Enhanced safety filtering and guidelines
- Better refusal of harmful requests
- More consistent ethical behavior

**Constitutional AI Integration:**
```
Training Process:
1. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)
2. Reward Model training
3. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
4. Constitutional AI principles
```

**Performance Comparisons:**

**Benchmark Results:**

def fibonacci_dynamic(n):
    """Generate nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]
