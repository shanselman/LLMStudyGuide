# Question 6: What role does temperature play in controlling LLM output?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Temperature is a hyperparameter that adjusts the randomness of token selection in text generation. A low temperature (e.g., 0.3) favors high-probability tokens, producing predictable outputs. A high temperature (e.g., 1.5) increases diversity by flattening the probability distribution. Setting temperature to 0.8 often balances creativity and coherence for tasks like storytelling.

**AI Answer:**
Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness and creativity of text generation by modifying the probability distribution over the vocabulary during sampling.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
The temperature parameter Ï„ modifies the softmax function:
```
P(w_i) = exp(logits_i / Ï„) / Î£_j exp(logits_j / Ï„)
```

**Effects of Different Temperature Values:**

**Low Temperature (Ï„ < 1.0):**
- **Ï„ = 0.1**: Very deterministic, almost greedy
- **Ï„ = 0.5**: Slightly more predictable than default
- **Effects**: Sharpens distribution, favors high-probability tokens
- **Use Cases**: Factual Q&A, formal writing, code generation

**High Temperature (Ï„ > 1.0):**
- **Ï„ = 1.5**: More creative and diverse
- **Ï„ = 2.0**: Highly random, potentially incoherent
- **Effects**: Flattens distribution, increases randomness
- **Use Cases**: Creative writing, brainstorming, diverse outputs

**Temperature = 1.0:**
- Uses the model's original probability distribution
- Balanced between predictability and creativity

**Practical Considerations:**
1. **Task-Dependent**: Different tasks require different temperature settings
2. **Model-Dependent**: Different models may need different temperature ranges
3. **Length-Dependent**: Longer sequences may benefit from dynamic temperature
4. **Combined with Other Techniques**: Often used with top-k or top-p sampling

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Dynamic Temperature**: Adjusts temperature based on context or position
- **Temperature Scheduling**: Changes temperature during generation
- **Conditional Temperature**: Different temperatures for different token types
