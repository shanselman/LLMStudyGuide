# Question 14: How can LLMs avoid catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Catastrophic forgetting occurs when fine-tuning erases prior knowledge. Mitigation strategies include:
• Rehearsal: Mixing old and new data during training.
• Elastic Weight Consolidation: Prioritizing critical weights to preserve knowledge.
• Modular Architectures: Adding task-specific modules to avoid overwriting.
These methods ensure LLMs retain versatility across tasks.

**AI Answer:**
Catastrophic forgetting occurs when neural networks lose previously learned information upon learning new tasks. This is particularly problematic for LLMs during fine-tuning, where models may lose their general capabilities while adapting to specific tasks.

**Understanding Catastrophic Forgetting:**

**Mechanism:**
- Neural networks adjust weights to minimize loss on new data
- These adjustments can overwrite previously learned patterns
- Particularly severe when new data distribution differs significantly
- More pronounced in smaller models and aggressive learning rates

**Symptoms:**
- Degraded performance on original tasks
- Loss of general knowledge and capabilities
- Reduced coherence in text generation
- Difficulty transferring to new tasks

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Regularization-Based Methods:**

**Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC):**
```
L_total = L_new + λ * Σ F_i * (θ_i - θ*_i)²
```
Where:
- F_i: Fisher information matrix (importance of parameter i)
- θ*_i: Optimal parameters from previous task
- λ: Regularization strength

**L2 Regularization:**
- Penalizes large deviations from pre-trained weights
- Simple but effective for mild fine-tuning
- Easy to implement and computationally efficient

**2. Rehearsal Methods:**

**Experience Replay:**
```python
# Mix old and new data during training
for batch in training_loop:
    new_data = sample_batch(new_dataset)
    old_data = sample_batch(stored_examples)
    mixed_batch = combine(new_data, old_data)
    train_on_batch(mixed_batch)
```

**Gradient Episodic Memory:**
- Store examples that produce diverse gradients
- Use these examples to constrain gradient updates
- Prevents updates that would damage old knowledge

**3. Architecture-Based Methods:**

**Progressive Networks:**
- Add new modules for each task
- Freeze previous task modules
- Use lateral connections to transfer knowledge

**Adapter Layers:**
- Insert small trainable modules between frozen layers
- Task-specific adapters learn new capabilities
- Original model remains unchanged

**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):**
- LoRA, QLoRA, Prefix Tuning
- Update only small subset of parameters
- Preserve most of the original model

**4. Knowledge Distillation:**

**Self-Distillation:**
```python
# Use original model as teacher
teacher_outputs = original_model(inputs)
student_outputs = finetuned_model(inputs)
distillation_loss = KL_divergence(teacher_outputs, student_outputs)
total_loss = task_loss + α * distillation_loss
```

**Multi-Task Learning:**

**Joint Training:**
- Train on multiple tasks simultaneously
- Share representations across tasks
- Prevents overspecialization

**Curriculum Learning:**
- Gradually introduce new tasks
- Maintain diversity in training data
- Balance task difficulties

**Practical Guidelines:**

**1. Learning Rate Management:**
- Use smaller learning rates for fine-tuning
- Implement learning rate schedules
- Different rates for different layers

**2. Data Strategy:**
- Maintain diverse training data
- Include general domain examples
- Regular evaluation on held-out tasks

**3. Monitoring and Evaluation:**
- Track performance on original tasks
- Use diverse evaluation benchmarks
- Implement early stopping based on general performance

**Advanced Techniques:**

**1. Modular Networks:**
- Task-specific modules
- Shared backbone architecture
- Dynamic module selection

**2. Meta-Learning:**
- Learn to learn new tasks quickly
- Preserve general learning ability
- MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)

**3. Continual Learning:**
- Sequential task learning
- Online learning capabilities
- Lifelong learning systems

**Evaluation Metrics:**

**Backward Transfer:**
- Performance on previously learned tasks
- Retention of original capabilities
- Stability across time

**Forward Transfer:**
- Ability to learn new tasks
- Speed of adaptation
- Generalization to unseen tasks
