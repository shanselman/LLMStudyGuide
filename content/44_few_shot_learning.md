# Question 44: What is few-shot learning, and what are its benefits?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Few-shot learning enables LLMs to perform tasks with minimal examples, leveraging pretrained knowledge. Benefits include reduced data needs, faster adaptation, and cost efficiency, making it ideal for niche tasks like specialized text classification.

**AI Answer:**
Few-shot learning enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks with minimal examples (typically 1-10) by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and in-context learning capabilities.

**Mechanism:**
- **In-context examples**: Task demonstrations in the prompt
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify task structure from examples
- **Knowledge transfer**: Apply pre-trained knowledge to new domains

**Example:**
```
Examples:
Input: "The weather is sunny" → Output: "Positive"
Input: "Traffic is terrible" → Output: "Negative"

New input: "The food was delicious" → Output: "Positive"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Data efficiency**: Minimal labeled data required
- **Rapid deployment**: Quick adaptation to new tasks
- **Cost effective**: Reduces annotation requirements
