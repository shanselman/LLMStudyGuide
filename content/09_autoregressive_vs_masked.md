# Question 9: How do autoregressive and masked models differ in LLM training?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Autoregressive models, like GPT, predict tokens sequentially based on prior tokens, excelling in generative tasks such as text completion. Masked models, like BERT, predict masked tokens using bidirectional context, making them ideal for understanding tasks like classification. Their training objectives shape their strengths in generation versus comprehension.

**AI Answer:**
Autoregressive and masked language models represent two fundamental approaches to training large language models, each with distinct training objectives, strengths, and optimal use cases.

**Autoregressive Models (e.g., GPT family):**

**Training Objective:**
- Predict the next token given all previous tokens
- Causal language modeling: P(x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô) = ‚àè P(x·µ¢|x‚ÇÅ, ..., x·µ¢‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
- Left-to-right processing with causal attention mask

**Architecture Features:**
- Unidirectional attention (can only attend to previous tokens)
- Causal masking prevents "cheating" by looking ahead
- Natural autoregressive generation during inference

**Strengths:**
- Excellent for text generation tasks
- Consistent training and inference procedures
- Natural fit for conversational AI and creative writing
- Can generate text of arbitrary length

**Masked Models (e.g., BERT family):**

**Training Objective:**
- Predict masked tokens using bidirectional context
- Masked Language Modeling: Predict original tokens from corrupted input
- Uses full context (left and right) for prediction

**Architecture Features:**
- Bidirectional attention (can attend to all positions)
- No causal masking during training
- Requires special handling for generation tasks

**Strengths:**
- Superior understanding of text semantics
- Excellent for classification and extraction tasks
- Better handling of context-dependent relationships
- More robust representations for downstream tasks

**Detailed Comparison:**

| Aspect | Autoregressive | Masked |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Attention** | Unidirectional (causal) | Bidirectional |
| **Training** | Next token prediction | Masked token prediction |
| **Generation** | Natural, left-to-right | Requires special techniques |
| **Understanding** | Limited by causal constraint | Full bidirectional context |
| **Best Use Cases** | Generation, completion | Classification, extraction |
| **Inference** | Sequential generation | Parallel processing |

**Hybrid Approaches:**

**1. Encoder-Decoder Models (T5, BART):**
- Encoder uses bidirectional attention (BERT-like)
- Decoder uses causal attention (GPT-like)
- Best of both worlds for many tasks

**2. Prefix LM (PaLM, GLM):**
- Bidirectional attention on prefix
- Autoregressive generation for suffix
- Unified training for understanding and generation

**3. Permuted Language Modeling (XLNet):**
- Autoregressive training with random permutations
- Captures bidirectional context while maintaining autoregressive properties

**Training Considerations:**

**Computational Efficiency:**
- Autoregressive: Sequential, harder to parallelize
- Masked: Highly parallelizable training
- Masked: Requires multiple forward passes for generation

**Data Efficiency:**
- Autoregressive: Learns from every position
- Masked: Only learns from masked positions (~15%)
- Masked: May need more training data
