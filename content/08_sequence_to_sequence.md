# Question 8: What are sequence-to-sequence models, and where are they applied?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models transform an input sequence into an output sequence, often of different lengths. They consist of an encoder to process the input and a decoder to generate the output. Applications include machine translation (e.g., English to Spanish), text summarization, and chatbots, where variable-length inputs and outputs are common.

**AI Answer:**
Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models are neural architectures designed to transform input sequences into output sequences, potentially of different lengths. They consist of an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that generates the output.

**Architecture Components:**
1. **Encoder**: Processes input sequence into fixed-size context vector
2. **Decoder**: Generates output sequence conditioned on context vector
3. **Attention Mechanism**: Allows decoder to focus on relevant input parts

**Traditional Seq2Seq (RNN-based):**
```
Encoder: h_t = RNN(x_t, h_{t-1})
Context: c = f(h_1, ..., h_T)
Decoder: s_t = RNN(y_{t-1}, s_{t-1}, c)
Output: p(y_t) = softmax(W_s s_t)
```

**Transformer-based Seq2Seq:**
- Encoder: Stack of self-attention layers
- Decoder: Stack of masked self-attention + cross-attention layers
- Parallel processing enables faster training

**Key Applications:**

**1. Machine Translation:**
- English â†” French, German, etc.
- Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems
- Examples: Google Translate, DeepL

**2. Text Summarization:**
- Document â†’ Summary
- Abstractive vs. extractive summarization
- News articles, research papers

**3. Dialogue Systems:**
- User utterance â†’ System response
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Context-aware conversation

**4. Code Generation:**
- Natural language â†’ Code
- Comment â†’ Implementation
- Examples: GitHub Copilot, CodeT5

**5. Question Answering:**
- Context + Question â†’ Answer
- Reading comprehension tasks
- Open-domain QA systems

**Challenges and Solutions:**

| Challenge | Problem | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Information Bottleneck | Fixed-size context vector | Attention mechanisms |
| Long Sequences | Vanishing gradients | Transformer architecture |
| Exposure Bias | Training vs. inference mismatch | Scheduled sampling |
| Repetition | Repetitive outputs | Coverage mechanisms |

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **BLEU**: N-gram overlap for translation
- **ROUGE**: Recall-oriented for summarization
- **METEOR**: Semantic similarity
- **BERTScore**: Contextual embeddings similarity
