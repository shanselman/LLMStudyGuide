# Question 22: What is multi-head attention, and how does it enhance LLMs?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Multi-head attention splits queries, keys, and values into multiple subspaces, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously. For example, in a sentence, one head might focus on syntax, another on semantics. This improves the model's ability to capture complex patterns.

**AI Answer:**
Multi-head attention is a key component of transformer architectures that runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different types of relationships and information simultaneously. Each "head" learns to attend to different aspects of the input, creating richer and more nuanced representations.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head₁, head₂, ..., head_h)W^O

where head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

**Architecture Details:**
- **h heads**: Typically 8, 12, or 16 in modern LLMs
- **Dimension splitting**: d_model = h × d_k (where d_k = d_v)
- **Parameter matrices**: Each head has its own W^Q, W^K, W^V
- **Output projection**: W^O combines all head outputs

**Why Multiple Heads Matter:**

**1. Diverse Attention Patterns:**
```python
# Head 1: Syntactic relationships
"The cat sat on the mat" 
# Attends: cat ↔ sat, mat ↔ on

# Head 2: Semantic relationships  
"The cat sat on the mat"
# Attends: cat ↔ mat (subject-location)

# Head 3: Sequential relationships
"The cat sat on the mat"
# Attends: adjacent word pairs
```

**2. Redundancy and Robustness:**
- Multiple heads provide backup mechanisms
- If one head fails, others compensate
- Improved generalization across domains

**3. Hierarchical Information:**
- Low-level heads: syntax, grammar
- Mid-level heads: semantic relations
- High-level heads: discourse, pragmatics

**Implementation Example:**
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        
        # Linear projections and reshape for multi-head
        Q = self.W_q(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        K = self.W_k(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        V = self.W_v(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        
        # Apply attention
        attention_output = self.scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask)
        
        # Concatenate heads and project
        concat_attention = attention_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(
            batch_size, -1, self.d_model)
        
        return self.W_o(concat_attention)
```

**Attention Head Specialization:**

**Research Findings:**
1. **Positional Heads**: Focus on relative positions
2. **Syntactic Heads**: Capture grammatical relationships
3. **Semantic Heads**: Learn meaning-based connections
4. **Rare Word Heads**: Specialize in low-frequency tokens

**Visualization Studies:**
```python
# Attention pattern analysis
def analyze_attention_heads(model, text):
    attention_weights = model.get_attention_weights(text)
    
    for head_idx in range(num_heads):
        pattern = attention_weights[head_idx]
        
        # Analyze patterns
        if is_syntactic_pattern(pattern):
            print(f"Head {head_idx}: Syntactic")
        elif is_semantic_pattern(pattern):
            print(f"Head {head_idx}: Semantic")
        elif is_positional_pattern(pattern):
            print(f"Head {head_idx}: Positional")
```

**Computational Benefits:**

**Parallel Processing:**
- All heads computed simultaneously
- Efficient GPU utilization
- Scalable with hardware improvements

**Parameter Efficiency:**
- Shared computation across heads
- Each head uses smaller dimensions
- Total parameters: d_model² (same as single large attention)

**Training Dynamics:**
- Different heads learn at different rates
- Diverse initialization prevents identical learning
- Natural ensemble effect

**Advanced Techniques:**

**1. Grouped Query Attention (GQA):**
```python
# Reduce memory by sharing K,V across head groups
# Used in LLaMA-2, PaLM-2
num_kv_heads = num_heads // 4  # Example: 32 heads → 8 KV heads
```

**2. Multi-Query Attention (MQA):**
```python
# Single K,V shared across all heads
# Faster inference, less memory
# Used in PaLM, Falcon
```

**3. Sparse Multi-Head Attention:**
```python
# Only attend to subset of positions per head
# Reduces O(n²) complexity
# Patterns: local, global, random
```

**Head Pruning and Analysis:**

**Importance Scoring:**
```python
def compute_head_importance(model, dataset):
    importance_scores = {}
    
    for layer_idx in range(model.num_layers):
        for head_idx in range(model.num_heads):
            # Measure performance drop when head is removed
            score = evaluate_without_head(model, layer_idx, head_idx, dataset)
            importance_scores[(layer_idx, head_idx)] = score
    
    return importance_scores
```

**Common Patterns:**
- **Early layers**: Mostly positional and syntactic heads
- **Middle layers**: Semantic and discourse heads
- **Late layers**: Task-specific heads
