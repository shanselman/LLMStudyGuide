# Question 7: What is masked language modeling, and how does it aid pretraining?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Masked language modeling (MLM) involves hiding random tokens in a sequence and training the model to predict them based on context. Used in models like BERT, MLM fosters bidirectional understanding of language, enabling the model to grasp semantic relationships. This pretraining approach equips LLMs for tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering.

**AI Answer:**
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is a self-supervised pretraining objective where random tokens in a sequence are masked, and the model learns to predict the original tokens based on bidirectional context.

**MLM Process:**
1. **Masking Strategy**: Replace 15% of tokens with:
   - [MASK] token (80% of the time)
   - Random token (10% of the time)
   - Original token (10% of the time)
2. **Prediction**: Model predicts original tokens using bidirectional context
3. **Loss Calculation**: Cross-entropy loss only on masked positions

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Bidirectional Context**: Unlike autoregressive models, MLM uses both left and right context
2. **Deep Understanding**: Forces model to understand semantic relationships
3. **Robust Representations**: Creates representations useful for many downstream tasks
4. **Self-Supervised**: No need for labeled data

**Comparison with Other Objectives:**

| Objective | Context | Strength | Weakness |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| MLM (BERT) | Bidirectional | Understanding tasks | Generation |
| Autoregressive (GPT) | Left-to-right | Generation | Limited context |
| Permuted LM (XLNet) | All permutations | Both understanding & generation | Complex training |

**Variants and Improvements:**
- **Whole Word Masking**: Masks entire words instead of subwords
- **Entity Masking**: Focuses on named entities
- **Span Masking**: Masks contiguous spans (SpanBERT)
- **Electra**: Replaced token detection instead of prediction

**Applications:**
- **BERT Family**: RoBERTa, ALBERT, DeBERTa
- **Downstream Tasks**: Classification, NER, question answering
- **Feature Extraction**: Pre-trained representations for other models
