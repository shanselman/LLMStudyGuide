# Question 43: How do transformers address the vanishing gradient problem?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
Transformers mitigate vanishing gradients via:
• Self-Attention: Avoiding sequential dependencies.
• Residual Connections: Allowing direct gradient flow.
• Layer Normalization: Stabilizing updates.
These ensure effective training of deep models, unlike RNNs.

**AI Answer:**
Transformers mitigate vanishing gradients through residual connections, layer normalization, and attention mechanisms that provide direct gradient paths between distant layers.

**Solutions:**
- **Residual connections**: Skip connections preserve gradient flow
- **Layer normalization**: Stabilizes gradients across layers
- **Attention mechanisms**: Direct connections between all positions
- **Proper initialization**: Prevents gradient scale issues

**Mathematical Analysis:**
```
With residuals: ∂L/∂x = ∂L/∂output × (1 + ∂F/∂x)
# Gradient always has identity component
```
