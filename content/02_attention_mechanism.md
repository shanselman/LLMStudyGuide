# Question 2: How does the attention mechanism function in transformer models?

**Human Answer (Hao Hoang):**
The attention mechanism allows LLMs to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when generating or interpreting text. It computes similarity scores between query, key, and value vectors, using operations like dot products, to focus on relevant tokens. For instance, in "The cat chased the mouse," attention helps the model link "mouse" to "chased." This mechanism improves context understanding, making transformers highly effective for NLP tasks.

**AI Answer:**
The attention mechanism is the core innovation that enables transformers to process sequences efficiently and capture long-range dependencies. It allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when processing each element.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

Where:
- Q (Query): What we're looking for
- K (Key): What we're looking in
- V (Value): The actual content
- d_k: Dimension of the key vectors (for scaling)

**Types of Attention:**
1. **Self-Attention**: Q, K, V come from the same sequence
2. **Cross-Attention**: Q comes from target, K and V from source
3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention heads running in parallel

**Step-by-step Process:**
1. Compute similarity scores between queries and keys
2. Scale by √d_k to prevent saturation
3. Apply softmax to get attention weights
4. Multiply weights with values to get weighted representation
